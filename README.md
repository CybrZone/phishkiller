# Phishkiller

## Overview
This script is designed to combat phishing attacks by flooding phisher databases with false information by flooding attacker database.

## How It Works
Using multi-threading, the script generates random email addresses and passwords from a predefined list of names. Each thread independently sends POST requests to a specified URL, submitting fictitious data to overwhelm phisher databases. This proactive approach aims to dilute and disrupt the accuracy of stolen data, offering a layer of protection to potential victims.
