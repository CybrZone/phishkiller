# Phishkiller

## Overview
This script is designed to combat phishing attacks by flooding phisher databases with false information by flooding attacker database.

## How It Works
Using multi-threading, the script generates random email addresses and passwords from a predefined list of names. Each thread independently sends POST requests to a specified URL, submitting fictitious data to overwhelm phisher databases. This proactive approach aims to dilute and disrupt the accuracy of stolen data, offering a layer of protection to potential victims.

## Purpose
Stop phishing


## Phishkiller usage
```bash
pip install faker
```

Run 
```
python3 phishkiller.py
 ```
 Then paste the url of the target
